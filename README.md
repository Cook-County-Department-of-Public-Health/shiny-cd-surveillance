## R Shiny Application for CCDPH Communicable Disease Surveillance Data

The Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) continuously collects data on communicable diseases in order to better understand their burden in our community, detect outbreaks, and prevent further infections. This app allows the user to explore some of this surveillance data for select communicable diseases and outbreaks that CCDPH has investigated. 

Data is not included in the repository; however, visitors are welcome to view and borrow code.

The application is live [here](https://ccdphcd.shinyapps.io/cd-surveillance/), but still under development so errors/inefficiencies might be noted. Feedback to improve the code is welcome.
